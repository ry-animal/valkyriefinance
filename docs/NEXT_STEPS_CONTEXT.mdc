## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### **1. Contract Deployment** (Highest Priority)
**Goal**: Deploy actual smart contracts to testnets for live testing

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up Foundry project in `packages/contracts/foundry/`
- [ ] Write ERC-4626 vault contract implementation
- [ ] Write Valkryie token contract (ERC-20 + governance + staking)
- [ ] Deploy to Sepolia testnet first
- [ ] Update contract addresses in `packages/contracts/src/addresses/index.ts`
- [ ] Test all operations with real deployed contracts

**Files to Create**:
- `packages/contracts/foundry/src/ValkryieVault.sol`
- `packages/contracts/foundry/src/ValkryieToken.sol`
- `packages/contracts/foundry/script/Deploy.s.sol`

### **2. Live Integration Testing**
**Goal**: Verify all frontend operations work with real contracts

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test wallet connection across all 5 chains
- [ ] Test vault deposit/withdraw operations
- [ ] Test token staking and governance features
- [ ] Verify transaction tracking in Web3 store
- [ ] Test error handling with real transaction failures

### **3. Enhanced AI Analytics**
**Goal**: Build sophisticated AI-powered DeFi insights

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement comprehensive AI router in tRPC
- [ ] Add vault performance analytics
- [ ] Create strategy recommendation engine
- [ ] Add real-time market data integration
- [ ] Build AI-powered risk assessment

**Files to Enhance**:
- `apps/server/src/routers/ai.ts` (currently basic)
- `apps/web/src/app/ai/page.tsx` (currently demo)

### **4. Cross-Chain Bridge Integration**
**Goal**: Enable seamless cross-chain asset swaps into vaults

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Research and select bridge providers (LayerZero, Wormhole, Across)
- [ ] Implement bridge quote aggregation
- [ ] Add cross-chain swap interface
- [ ] Integrate with existing vault operations
- [ ] Add cross-chain transaction tracking

## 🛠️ Development Commands

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Start development servers
bun run dev:apps

# Run tests
bun test                    # All unit tests
bun run test:e2e           # E2E tests

# Build everything
bun build                  # Full build (~22s)
bun check-types           # TypeScript validation
```

### **Database Commands**
```bash
cd apps/server
bun run db:studio         # Open Drizzle Studio
bun run db:migrate        # Apply migrations
bun run db:generate       # Generate new migrations
```

## 📋 Known Issues & Technical Debt

### **Minor Issues**
- AI router not fully integrated with main tRPC router (simplified for build stability)
- Contract addresses are placeholder values (need real deployment)
- Some E2E tests may need wallet connection mocking

### **Future Enhancements**
- Add localStorage persistence for UI preferences
- Implement optimistic UI updates with TanStack Query
- Add comprehensive error reporting and monitoring
- Enhance mobile responsiveness

## 🎯 Phase Priorities

### **Phase 4: Production Deployment** (Next)
- Deploy smart contracts to testnets
- Live integration testing
- Security audits and testing
- Performance optimization

### **Phase 5: Advanced DeFi Features**
- Uniswap V4 custom hooks
- Cross-chain bridge integration
- Automated yield optimization
- Advanced portfolio analytics

### **Phase 6: AI-Powered Optimization**
- ML model integration
- Real-time strategy recommendations
- Risk assessment algorithms
- Predictive market analysis

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **When Starting Development**
1. Always run `bun install` first
2. Ensure PostgreSQL is running
3. Apply database migrations: `cd apps/server && bun run db:migrate`
4. Start with `bun run dev:apps` for parallel development

### **Before Making Changes**
1. Run `bun check-types` to verify TypeScript
2. Run `bun test` to ensure tests pass
3. Check build with `bun build` before major changes

### **For Contract Work**
1. The contracts package is ready but needs Foundry setup
2. All ABIs and types are prepared for real contract integration
3. Contract addresses need updating after deployment
