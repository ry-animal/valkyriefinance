## 🚀 Next Action: Start with Tenderly DevNet

### Step 1: Tenderly Setup (Today)

```bash
cd packages/contracts/foundry

# Install Tenderly CLI
npm install -g @tenderly/cli

# Login and initialize
tenderly login
tenderly init

# Update tenderly.yaml with your account details
# Edit: account_id and project_slug
```

### Step 2: Deploy to DevNet (Tomorrow)

```bash
# Create DevNet
tenderly devnet spawn-rpc --project valkryie-finance --template mainnet

# Set environment variable
export TENDERLY_RPC_URL="https://virtual.mainnet.rpc.tenderly.co/your-devnet-id"

# Deploy contracts
forge script script/DeployTenderly.s.sol --rpc-url $TENDERLY_RPC_URL --broadcast

# Validate monitoring
forge test --match-contract TenderlyIntegrationTest -v
```

### Step 3: Validate Everything (Week 1)
