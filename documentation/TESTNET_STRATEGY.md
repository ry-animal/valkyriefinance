# Valkyrie Finance Testnet Development Strategy

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This document outlines our comprehensive testnet development strategy before mainnet launch. We'll build and test all production features on Sepolia testnet with real protocol integrations to ensure a smooth mainnet deployment.

## ðŸ“‹ Testnet Development Phases

### **Phase 1: Production-Like Testnet Deployment (Week 1-2)**

#### **Objectives**
