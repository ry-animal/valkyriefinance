# Valkryie Finance - Project Status

## Current Status (Updated: 2025-06-17)

**Overall Progress**: Phase 5 (AI & Analytics Integration) is now largely complete. The core Go-based AI engine is fully operational and integrated with the tRPC server, providing advanced portfolio optimization, risk analysis, and market intelligence capabilities.

**Next Development Priorities**:

- **Frontend UI for AI Features**: Build out the user interface in the web app to display and interact with the new AI-driven insights.
- **Uniswap V4 Advanced Hooks**: Begin development on advanced Uniswap V4 hook integrations as per the roadmap.
- **Governance System**: Start prototyping the on-chain governance system for protocol and AI strategy parameters.

### Key Achievements

- **AI Engine Live**: The high-performance Go-based AI engine is complete and serving live data.
- **Full tRPC Integration**: All AI endpoints (`optimizePortfolioAdvanced`, `assessPortfolioRisk`, `getTokenAnalysis`, `getMarketIndicators`, `getAIEngineStatus`) are successfully integrated and tested.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implemented resilient error handling between the tRPC server and the AI engine.

### Current Capabilities

- **AI-Powered Portfolio Optimization**: Users can submit their portfolio data and receive advanced, AI-driven rebalancing recommendations.
- **Real-Time Risk Metrics**: The platform can calculate and return key portfolio risk metrics (VaR, Sharpe Ratio, Beta, etc.) in real-time.
- **Automated Token & Market Analysis**: The system provides on-demand technical and sentiment analysis for specific tokens and the overall market.
